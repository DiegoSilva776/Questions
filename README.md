# Questions
Questions is a Javascript plugin that takes a data model of a Question and provides an UI for it. 

It allows the user to select an alternative, in case of a single answer question, or multiple options in the case of a True or False question. 

It tracks the users' choices while they're selecting each option, and once the answer has been submitted, it let's you catch it for evaluation.
